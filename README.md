## Deprecation notice:   
No moar update <3    
## Requirements:  
- Working WSLg  
- vlc installed on WSL
- Windows 11(Tested)  
- Older Windows with wt installed (NOT Tested)  
## Instructions:
Clone this repo both on your local windows machine AND WSL instance  
Launch the init.sh script to download Bad Apple!! on your WSL instance(This is only for first time setup)  
Launch the Bad_WSLg.exe on windows and enjoy the show!!  
## How it works?  
The init.sh script uses yt-dlp to download Bad Apple!! onto your local WSL  
Then the "main program" uses a glorified script turned executable to launch vlc from WSL  
### Why did i "make" this?  
This is just something cool i noticed when i ran cvlc onto WSLg  
After i noticed the cool i bodged a one-liner "program" to help lesser nerds enjoy the cool  
Instead of following boring copy-paste instructions here have an .exe
